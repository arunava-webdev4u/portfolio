        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p class="txt_21">Hi, my name is Arunava Das. I live in West Bengal, India. I was born on 3rd July 2001. I live with my parents. I am an
        engineering student, I have done my schooling from Painta J.M. High school, Barddhaman. I had got 85% and 75% marks in
        my 10th and 12th board exams respectively. Currently, I am pursuing B.Tech in Information Technology from Academy Of
        Technology, Adisaptagram.</p>
        
        <p class="txt_21">So, I live in a village Painta, Barddhaman in West Bengal. I came from a middle-class family. I went to Painta J.M. High
        School, where I finished my secondary and higher secondary. After that, I took admission in the Academy Of Technology
        college through WBJEE (2019), where my rank was 9206. I selected the IT branch for my graduation because I am pretty
        much interested in technology and science from my childhood.</p>

        <p class="txt_21">Talking about my hobbies, I like to watch different kinds of movies. I like to watch cricket, my favorite game. And A B
        De Villers is my favorite cricketer. I like painting, photography, listening to songs. I also like to play chess.
